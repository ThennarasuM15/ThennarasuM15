#🌟 Thennarasu M – Data Analyst | Turning Data into Decisions
---
I’m someone who believes data isn't just numbers — it's decisions waiting to be made, stories ready to be told.
I’m a data-driven problem solver with a background in Mechanical Engineering and a growing passion for analytics. My journey into data wasn’t accidental—it was a conscious shift driven by curiosity and a desire to solve real-world problems using numbers, patterns, and logic.

I began my professional path as an Inspection Engineer at National Inspection Services, Trichy. That role taught me the value of accuracy and standards in real-time operations.

📍 My next stop was Muscat, Oman, where I joined Apave Gulf LLC. While my core role remained in inspections, I naturally stepped into data-related responsibilities — handling site reports, performing data entry, and transforming field data into meaningful insights. Over time, I started managing audit reports, QMS documentation, and became a trusted report controller supporting the operations team.

📈 That’s when I discovered my passion for data.

Even after receiving an offer from SABIC (Saudi Arabia), I chose to pivot. I returned to India with one clear goal: to become a Data Analyst.

🎓 I upskilled through a 3-month data analytics program at ExcelR ,Bangalore and then completed a 6-month internship at AI Variant, Bangalore, where I worked on real-world projects involving data cleaning, visualization, KPI tracking, and dashboard building.

Today, I’m independently working on projects, strengthening my skills in Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python, and actively looking for opportunities to contribute as a Data Analyst.

📌 Tools I work with: Excel | SQL | Power BI | Python | Tableau | Statistics
📌 Key strengths: Data cleaning, storytelling, reporting automation, dashboard creation, quality-focused thinking.
